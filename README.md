## Instructions
- Aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena. Design 2â€“5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon.
- Use your visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomenon.
- Create one of the following visualizations for city officials:
  - Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.
  - Advanced: A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.
  - The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during your analysis.

- Create your final presentation:
  - Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
  - Ensure your presentation is professional, logical, and visually appealing.
